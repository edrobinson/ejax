### EjaxTraits Documentation

The project provides a PHP trait that handles the complete
request and response processes.

Use the trait in your classes to serve client side requests.

```
<?php

/*
  File: Ejax/EjaxTraits.php

  This trait is what drives your server classes by
  detecting a request, routing it to the proper method
  and returning the response to the client.
  
  Usage:
    Include this use statement in your server classes:
    
    use EjaxTraits
  
    In your server class constructor just call processRequest().
  
  This trait contains 3 methods that drive all of the request processing
  for your service classes:
  
  1. canProcessRequest() determines if there is a request available to process
     based on the presence of the $_POST global. Returns true or false.
     
  2. processRequest() reads the PHP input stream to get the raw request data.
     Then it json_decodes raw data and calls the dispatcher.
     
  3. dispatcher() extracts the requested method and its arguments, 
     makes sure the method is calllable in your class then calls the metdod
     and returns the response to the client.
